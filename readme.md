# Rooster Teeth is hiring Web Developers.

Join Rooster Teeth’s growing team of developers to help maintain one of the most popular entertainment production companies' web, mobile, and console presence seen by millions each day.

The position is contract-to-hire, with a short-term project to help finish out a major rebuild of the main website, a large-scale Laravel (PHP) installation. The code is well-tested and solidly architected, but has a list of outstanding tickets that need completion before we can release. The project also uses Node (both for micro services and build tasks), so strong JavaScript skills are a big plus.

Past the website, the job description becomes much more flexible - we are looking for developers who can pick up new software, languages, or technologies at a moment’s notice. This includes, but is not limited to, taking on new and exciting platforms such as mobile, console, and even game development. You'll be part of a small team who loves solving hard problems and is not confined to a single job function.

# Skills & Requirements

- Strong experience with PHP and large MVC patterns. 
- Strong understanding of SOLID (objected-oriented design).
- Experience working within a git-driven environment. 
- The right attitude is a must; Willingness to take on and find the right solution to any problem. 
- Able to take instruction and follow a set development standard. 
- Able to manage one’s own schedule to meet deadlines. 

## Bonus

- Having an amazing GitHub profile and/or being involved in Open-Source software. 
- Familiarity with development frameworks, specifically Laravel.
- Familiarity with modern Javascript (CommonJs modules, Node, FP). 
- Familiarity with vagrant.
- Familiarity with other languages such as Ruby, Perl or Python. 
- Familiarity with mobile or console development.
- Familiarity with unit-testing and continuous integration.
